# Phishing Email Detection System (Final Year Project)

This project is a hybrid phishing email detection system that uses both a supervised machine learning model (Random Forest) and a manual checklist-based approach to classify emails as phishing or legitimate.

It was developed as part of my final year project at the University of West London.

## Key Features
- Real-world dataset and synthetically generated dataset for testing generalisation.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorisation.
- Custom checklist detection rules: domain mismatch, urgency, sensitive info, spelling, etc.
- Confusion matrix visualisations and evaluation metrics included.
